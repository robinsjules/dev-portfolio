            Deeply passionate about technology and its power to transform lives,
            I strive to create, innovate, and improve products and services for
            the contemporary world. During my recent internship at InterSystems
            Asia Pacific as a Software Engineer Intern, I developed REST APIs,
            SQL triggers, and an AI chatbot for an IT Solutions and Consulting
            firm to aid in migrating their current technology stack to the IRIS
            data platform.

            Beyond the tech space, I am a foodie and avid traveler. Exploring
            the unknown has always felt natural to me, and I am always up for a
            new adventure and good challenge. Let's go on this journey of
            embracing uncertainty and creating a better world together!
